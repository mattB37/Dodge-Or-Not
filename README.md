# Dodge-Or-Not-
- A League of Legends Tool

What is DodgeOrNot?

I created dodgeOrNot in hopes of using it as a stats tool on a website designed to make it easier for people to get information about teamates while in champ select. Unfortunately Riot Games did not approve my application for a product key so I am unable to make the application public. However, I am posting this 
so that someone else who has a better idea might learn something about accessing riots api and manipulating the data. 
  - This repo contains a modified version of the program I used to gather stats for my website https://dodgeornot.herokuapp.com/
